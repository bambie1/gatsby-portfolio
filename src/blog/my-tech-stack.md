# My tech stack

When I start a new project, I usually reach for familiar tools, libraries, frameworks, etc. This is a quick breakdown of my preferences.


- **Design**: *<a href="http://www.figma.com/" target="_blank">Figma</a>*

  Oh, Figma!
  I usually start off any project with a Figma design. This is very essential for me to properly work through an idea before jumping to VS Code.
  Figma is an amazing prototyping tool that makes it so easy to visualize and iterate through designs. It's also free, and has a huge community of designers from whom a lot can be learned.


- **Front-end framework**: *<a href="http://www.nextjs.org/" target="_blank">Next.js</a>*

  Next.js is a full-stack React framework that provides a LOT of features that has kept me attached to it. My 3 favorites are 'File-based routing', 'Static or server-side pages', and 'Production optimization'.
  Being full-stack framework means it comes with an express server built-in (available via API routes).
  A close-second is Gatsby.js, which I used for this website. It has similar features as Next.js, and has just as great documentation.



- **Styling (CSS)**: *It's complicated*

  There's usually 3 options for this: <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank">Tailwind CSS</a>, <a href="https://mui.com/" target="_blank">Material-UI</a>, or custom SCSS (with <a href="https://reach.tech/" target="_blank">Reach UI</a> for simple accessible components).
  I'm currently on the Tailwind-train, primarily because of the significantly less number of CSS files I create, AND their amazing documentation. These two pros overshadow the obvious lengthy class names.



- **Authentication / Database**: *<a href="http://www.firebase.com/" target="_blank">Firebase</a>*

  Not much to say here. Firebase provides a JSON-like database (Firestore) which stores data as nested documents and collections (similar to MongoDB), and out-of-the-box authentication options.



- **E-Commerce**: *<a href="http://www.shopify.com/" target="_blank">Shopify</a>*

  This is an easy one. Shopify handles e-commerce (product inventory, shipping, discounts, etc.) very well, and expose this data via an API which allows you to easily build a fully-custom website powered by Shopify.
