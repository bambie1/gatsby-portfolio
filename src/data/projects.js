          Working with entrepreneurs has always been a passion of mine. And,
          with SoPlugged, I got to build a platform to help black entrepreneurs
          showcase their businesses, and increase their visibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          I built it with one of my preferred frameworks: Next.js (with
          Typescript), and hosted on Vercel. Algolia search is also used to make
          the search experience very user-friendly

          This is a website for my local church. We were missing a very reliable
          digital presence for some time, and as a developer, I took on the task
          of creating this.
        </p>
        <p>
          I opted for WordPress as my weapon of choice since the site was going
          to be maintained and updated by non-developers (different ways to
          solve a problem). Given the huge demand for ways to donate online in
          recent yearsr, I also added an embedded{" "}
          <TextLink href="https://kweeve.com/">Kweeve</TextLink> form to make it
          easy for members to give wherever they are
        </p>
        <p className="mb-7">
          If you happen to be in Ottawa on Sunday, and are looking for a place
          of worship, we'd love to welcome you!
