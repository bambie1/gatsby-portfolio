              Hi friend! Iâ€™m Benaiah, a UI/UX developer and web consultant,
              based out of Ottawa, Canada. I love to create amazing digital
              experiences for clients with different tools at my disposal.
            </p>

              <TextLink href="https://fullscript.com/">Fullscript</TextLink> as

              My other creative outlet is music... specifically the keyboard.
              There's just something about playing a tune you love on the
              keyboard, and putting your twist on it. A close second is playing
              table-tennis. Slicing... smashing... spinning.
